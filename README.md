As our transportation industry upgrading and transformation, a desirable system should be a sustainable one. In great metropolitan area, under green transportation framework and imbalanced job-housing situation, some people choose to travel through non-private vehicles. Some governments would endorse such behavior as congestion deteriorates. It becomes important for transportation planners to understand and management the particular demand precisely. For this study, the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (FHWA, 2017) is being selected, targeting the individuals in urban area travel through walking, bicycling, public transit and taxi for their work trips. A discrete choice (multinomial logit), unsupervised (k-means clustering) and supervised models are fitted to test the predictive performance, with the vision to deeply master the system partial demand and design better traveling system for citizens indirectly. Through a model performance testing, the results show that some supervised learning methods could be considered as a promising reference for predicting travel mode.
